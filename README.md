# NodeMCU-ESP8266-Web-Server

This is a functional implementation of a Web server API for IoT applications using NodeMCU that integrates ESP8266 module.

## Instalation 
Here I use step by step motor, servo control, and leds, that you can control using the endpoints from anywere, from the web Client using simple Vanilla Javascript with fetch in this repository, that only needs to know the IP of your node mcu, that you can set in the .ino file. To compile and run in a NodeMCU board only you need to install the [ESP8266/arduinoi available On GitHub] (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) library in your Arduino IDE and select the board NodeMCU v.1 (ESP-12E Module) which depends of your version of NodeMCU board ;)
